## Install Apache
### command
yum update -y  
yum install -y httpd.x86_64  
systemctl start httpd.service  
systemctl enable httpd.service  
更改安全组 添加http 80端口 inbound  
echo "hello world" > /var/www/html/index.html  
echo "Hello World from $(hostname -f)" > /var/www/html/index.html  

## AWS CI/CD
What we’d like is to push our code “in a repository” and have it deployed onto the AWS
-  Automatically
-  The right way
-  Making sure it’s tested before deploying
-  With possibility to go into different stages (dev, test, pre-prod, prod)
-  With manual approval where needed

We’ll learn about
- AWS CodeCommit: storing our code
- AWS CodePipeline: automating our pipeline from code to ElasticBeanstalk
- AWS CodeBuild: building and testing our code
- AWS CodeDeploy: deploying the code to EC2 fleets (not Beanstalk)

Continuous Integration
- Developers push the code to a code repository often (GitHub / CodeCommit / Bitbucket / etc…)
- A testing / build server checks the code as soon as it’s pushed (CodeBuild / Jenkins CI / etc…)
- The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed / failed
- Find bugs early, fix bugs
- Deliver faster as the code is tested
- Deploy often
- Happier developers, as they’re unblocked

Continuous Delivery
- Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed.
- Ensures deployments happen often and are quick
- Shift away from “one release every 3 months” to ”5 releases a day”
- That usually means automated deployment
- - CodeDeploy
- - Jenkins CD
- - Spinnaker
- - Etc…
